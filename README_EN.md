# *RoutineGuard* [EN]

Project aiming to **help dependent persons** (elderly, for example) with technological **solutions based on a routine**, to monitor them and to analyse if everything is alright, at any time.  
It aims also in **making the communications easier in case of incident**, reducing the time between the incident and rescue intervention.  

# Technical Solutions

This projects uses mainly a *Raspberry Pi*, an *Arduino*, an a bunch of sensors. The Raspberry Pi controls everything, it's the core of the entire system.  
It communicates with the sensors placed all around the house, and with the Arduino (and its dedicated sensors) which makes a bracelet that the person wears.
